# UNMANNED_AERIAL_VEHICLE_DETECTION_AND_ROUTE_ESTIMATION
 The UAV Detection and Route Estimation project involved using Kalman Filters to detect and predict the trajectory of unmanned aerial vehicles. The goal was to track UAV movement and estimate their routes accurately, applying computer vision techniques for real-time processing and analysis.
